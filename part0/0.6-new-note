browser UI: push note to notes -> redrawNotes -> send note to server
browser->server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
server->browser [{"message": "note created"}]


note:
After pressing submit button browser makes a new element from input fields text. It is named note.
Then that element gets pushed to notes array. Then function reDrawNotes is called. After that
note is sent to server. Page makes a HTTP POST api call and receives note created message if it was successful.
